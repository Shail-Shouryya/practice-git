This file is present in branch A.
This line was changed in branch A, with no other changes anywhere else in the file. This was then pushed to branch A, a pull request was made to merge into master, and then merged. Branch B will not pull this change, will make changes to the file (twice), then try to rebase the first commit. This is a test to see if there will be rebase conflicts due to the merge.s
This line will be merged into master with no further changes.
This line will also be merged into master with no further changes.
This line was modified in another branch. This sentence was added in a second change and commit in that branch. This was added the third time. Attempted to rebase and didn't face any conflicts, so I think merge conflicts during rebasing must come from more complicated conditions.
This is to test to see if changes in one file will cause conflicts if merged to master when trying to rebase from another branch that doesn't have the same changes - even if the changes in that branch don't conflict.
